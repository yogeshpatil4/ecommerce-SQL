## 📦 Dataset Used

This project uses a collection of CSV files representing a simplified e-commerce platform. The datasets are:

- **df_Customers.csv**: Contains customer details such as customer ID, city, and state.
- **df_Orders.csv**: Includes order-specific information such as order ID, order status, purchase and approval timestamps.
- **df_OrderItems.csv**: Contains individual items within orders including product ID, price, and quantity.
- **df_Products.csv**: Lists product details including product ID, category, and product name.
- **df_Payments.csv**: Holds information about payment methods, values, and number of installments.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning

To ensure accurate analysis, several data cleaning steps were performed using SQL:

- **Converted datetime columns** (`order_purchase_timestamp` and `order_approved_at`) to proper DATETIME format using `STR_TO_DATE`.
```sql
UPDATE df_orders 
SET order_purchase_timestamp = 
STR_TO_DATE(order_purchase_timestamp,'%Y-%m-%d %H:%i:%s');

ALTER TABLE df_orders MODIFY order_purchase_timestamp DATETIME;


  ```

- **Removed rows with missing approval timestamps** from the `df_orders` table.
```sql
 DELETE  FROM ecommerce.df_orders
WHERE order_approved_at="";

UPDATE df_orders SET order_approved_at=
STR_TO_DATE(order_approved_at,'%Y-%m-%d %H:%i:%s');

ALTER TABLE df_orders MODIFY order_approved_at DATETIME;
```
  
- **Deleted rows with empty product category names** from the `df_products` table.
 ```sql
DELETE FROM df_products
WHERE product_category_name="";
```
- **Removed duplicate product entries** by using a CTE and `ROW_NUMBER()` to identify and keep only the first occurrence of each `product_id`.
```sql
  WITH cte AS 
(SELECT *,ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY product_id) AS rn
 FROM df_products)
DELETE FROM df_products WHERE product_id IN (SELECT product_id FROM cte WHERE rn >1)
```

These steps ensured consistent and clean data before starting the analysis.
